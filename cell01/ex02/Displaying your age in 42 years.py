# 1. Define a variable for the current age (you can change this number).
# The example output of '67' suggests a starting age of 25 (25 + 42 = 67).
current_age = 25

# 2. Add your current age and 42, and assign the result to my_age.
# This uses the simple addition operator (+) for integers.
my_age = current_age + 42

# 3. Display the my_age variable, followed by a new line.
print(my_age)
